# Notice:

The es5 version of this directive is not yet ready to use, as I'm unable to figure out how to get the host element of the directive using the ElementRef class that comes with Angular 2 standard.  It should work for the most part except for that.  If you encounter errors, please let me know via issues on GitHub, or (even better) if you are able to contribute, please send me a message or a pull request.

Thanks!
